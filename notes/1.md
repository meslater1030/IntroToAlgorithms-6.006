Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

Building a fence around your yard would be a real-word example of a convex hull. Presumably you'd have a number of known points that represented the boundaries of your property and it could be in your best interest to minimize the size of the your building materials and therefore the length of the fence.

Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

Efficient use of memory can be very important in a real-world setting.

Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

A dictionary is a data structure that organizes information by a particular key. Lookup within a dictionary is very fast O(1), however a dictionary isn't a particularly effective tool for mapping relationships between various nodes or inputs.

How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

These two problems are similar in that they both involve an entity moving between various points. They are different in that the traveling salesperson will begin and end in the same place whereas the shortest-path has a beginning point that is different from its endpoint.

Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

When NASA launches the space shuttle they need the best solution for the amount of gas the astronauts should bring. Too much gas will lead to problems with being overweight which will effect the trajectory of the shuttle not to mention additional gas to carry the weight of the additional gas. Too little gas could have catastrophic consequences in terms of loss of life and dealing with unanticipated needs. On the other hand, the amount of food to pack can handle an approximate solution. The astronauts can survive for a relatively long time with no food at all and extra dehydrated food neither weighs much nor takes up much space.
